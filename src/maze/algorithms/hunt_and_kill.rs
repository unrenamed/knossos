/// An implementation of the "Hunt & Kill" algorithm for generating mazes
///
/// The algorithm consists of two main phases: walk and hunt, which repeat from row to row.
///
/// Here is how it works in detail:
///
/// 1. Chooses a starting location
///
/// 2. Performs a random walk, carving passages to unvisited neighbors, until the current cell has
///    no unvisited neighbors.
///
/// 3. Enters the “hunt” mode, where you scan the grid looking for an
///    unvisited cell that is adjacent to a visited cell. If found, carves a passage between the two
///    and lets the formerly unvisited cell be the new starting location.
///
/// 4. Repeats steps 2 and 3 until the "hunt" mode scans the entire grid and finds no unvisited
///    cells.
///
/// # Optimization
///
/// It is worth mentioning that unlike the standard version of this algorithm which gets a little
/// slow towards the end, where the "hunt" phase has to search over nearly the entire grid to find a
/// candidate cell, this implementation has a simple optimization that speeds up the later stages of
/// the algorithm. Thus, this algorithm is still pretty fast

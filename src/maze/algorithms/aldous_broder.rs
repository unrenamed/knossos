/// An implementation of Aldous-Broder's algorithm for generating mazes.
///
/// The problem domain the algorithm was created for is finding unform spanning trees. Here is how
/// it works:
///
/// 1. Chooses any vertex.
///
/// 2. Chooses a connected neighbor of the vertex and travels to it. If the neighbor has not yet
///    been visited, adds the traveled edge to the spanning tree.
///
/// 3. Repeats step 2 until all vertexes have been visited.

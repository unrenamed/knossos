/// The "Recursive Division" algorithm for generating mazes
///
/// According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_division_method)
/// and [James Buck's maze generation blogs](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm)
/// this algorithm should be implemented as a wall adder, as opposed to the rest of the algorithms
/// in this library which are designated as "passage carvers". In a nutshell, the idea is to
/// recursively divide the original grid with no walls — call this a "chamber" — into smaller
/// subchambers with randomly positioned walls and single passages within them. This fractal nature
/// makes this algorithm novel. You could theoretically continue the process indefinitely at
/// progressively finer and finer levels of detail on demand. This may be useful when developing a
/// game where a player wanders from one section of the maze to another without a need to store the
/// entire maze in the memory.
///
/// My implementation of this algorithm is a bit different from the above. The design of this
/// library supports only the passage-carving technique (mixing both techniques would lead to an
/// uglier API and less efficient generation mechanism, which I tested using benchmarks). Given that
/// I've slightly modified the algorithm to be rather a "passage carver". The method and its fractal
/// nature remain though. Of course, the generation process would be less fancy this way, but this
/// library has nothing to do with visualizing the generation progress step-by-step. If you're
/// interested in this side of the maze generation world, feel free to check my other program for
/// the terminal called [Daedalus](https://github.com/unrenamed/daedalus).
///
/// It's also worth mentioning that the algorithm's fractal nature leads to some visual artifacts
/// and bottlenecks like a single passage between two sections that effectively divide the entire
/// maze into two distinct regions, thus making it easy to spot the passage and work backward to a
/// solution.

# Knossos

Knossos is a simple and flexible Rust library and CLI tool for generating mazes using various algorithms. It includes built-in utilities for rendering mazes as ASCII, images, or game maps and supports saving them in multiple formats.

## Reference

In Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He hired the Athenian architect, mathematician, and inventor Daedalus to design his palace and so cleverly was it constructed that no one who entered could find their way back out without a guide. In other versions of this same story it was not the palace itself which was designed in this way but the labyrinth within the palace which was built to house the half-man/half-bull the Minotaur. In order to keep Daedalus from telling the secrets of the palace, Minos locked him and his son Icarus in a high tower at Knossos and kept them prisoner. Daedalus fashioned wings made of wax and bird's feathers for himself and his son, however, and escaped their prison but Icarus, flying too close to the sun, melted his wings and fell to his death.

## Overview

Knossos currently supports only one type of mazes: **orthogonal**, which is a standard maze layout of rectangular passages.

The library supports the following generation algorithms:

- [Aldous-Broder](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/17/maze-generation-aldous-broder-algorithm)
- [Binary Tree](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/1/maze-generation-binary-tree-algorithm)
- [Eller's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm)
- [Growing Tree](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm)
- [Hunt-and-Kill](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm)
- [Kruskal's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm)
- [Prim's](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm)
- [Recursive Backtracking](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)
- [Recursive Division](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm)
- [Sidewinder](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/3/maze-generation-sidewinder-algorithm)

Knossos supports the following output types:

- **ASCII** With the ASCII output option, you can effortlessly display a maze on the console or save it to a file to visualize its appearance.

- **Game map** If you are looking to create your own game featuring pseudo 3D graphics or testing your ray casting algorithm implementation, you can transform a maze into a game map using this formatter. It offers various configuration options, including the `span` value for specifying the distance between opposing walls, the characters `wall` and `passage` for map construction, and the ability to randomly place start `S` and goal `G` points along the borders.

- **Image** Utilizing the Image output feature, you have the capability to render a maze into PNG or JPG formats (simply utilize the appropriate filename extension). This output type offers extensive customization options, enabling you to define custom margins, wall and passage widths, as well as background and foreground colors.

## Installation

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```no_test
cargo add knossos
```

Or add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```no_test
[dependencies]
knossos = "1.2.0"
```

## Usage

Knossos is designed to be super easy and convenient to use. Here are some usage examples of how to generate, display and save mazes:

### Generate with Default Parameters

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new().build();
```

### Generate with Custom Parameters

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new()
 .height(10)
 .width(10)
 .algorithm(Box::new(GrowingTree::new(Method::Random)))
 .build();
```

### Display Mazes

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new().build();
println!("{}", &maze);
```

### Save to File

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new().build();

// Save as ASCII text
maze.save("output/maze.txt", AsciiNarrow).unwrap();
// Save as a game map (with adjustable span size)
maze.save("output/maze_game_map.txt", GameMap::new().span(3)).unwrap();
// Save as a PNG image (adjusting wall and passage sizes)
maze.save("output/maze.png", Image::new().wall(10).passage(30)).unwrap();
```

### Format for Further Processing or Logging

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new().build();

// Convert to ASCII text
let ascii = maze.format(AsciiNarrow).into_inner();
// Convert to a game map
let game_map = maze.format(GameMap::new()).into_inner();
// Convert to an RGB image buffer
let rgb_image = maze.format(Image::new().wall(10).passage(30)).into_inner();
```

You can find more examples in the [examples](examples) directory. To run the example:

```bash
cargo run --example mazes
```

### Seeding for Deterministic Mazes

By default, each generated maze is randomized, producing a different layout every time. However,
you can use a seed value to ensure that the same maze is generated consistently across runs.
This is useful for debugging, testing, or sharing the exact same maze with others.

```rust,no_run
use knossos::maze::*;

// Generate a maze with a fixed seed
let maze = OrthogonalMazeBuilder::new().seed(Some(40)).build();
```

Passing `None` as the seed (or omitting the `.seed()` method) will result in a random maze each time.

## Benchmarks

Knossos uses [Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) for statistical benchmarking.

### Running Benchmarks

To run benchmarks locally:

```bash
cargo bench
```

This generates both terminal output and an HTML report in:
